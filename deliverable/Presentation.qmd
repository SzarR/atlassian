## Background {.smaller style="color: black; text-transform:none"}

-   Address rumors of employee engagement scores trending negatively
-   Better understand what drives engagement and its subsequent impact on performance
-   Provided with a dataset with several key metrics, including survey results, performance ratings and employee information
-   **Goal: Provide leaders with actionable insights for course correcting low engagement scores**
    -   But also helping leaders understand the cost of low engagement to the organization

## Purpose {.smaller style="color: black"}

-   Why care about employee engagement? Companies with highly engaged employees grew revenue 2.5x than those with low engaged employees

    -   When employees connect their work to customer impact, they identify with the company's purpose which leads to organizational performance

    -   Employees are Atlassian's greatest asset. By investing in them to do their best work, they will be more likely to exert themselves to be more successful

    -   In a software company, the capability to deliver quality software quickly certainly serves as a strategic advantage

## Procedure {.smaller style="color: black"}

-   What did we do to the data in order for it to tell us what we wanted to know?

-   First, we set up our variables in a way that makes more sense to analyze

    -   Calculated the time difference between time zones to understand whether the gap is meaningful

    -   Translated performance ratings into numeric values - to calculate averages

    -   Developed a novel "Engagement Favorability Index" that collapsed a 5-point scale into Positive/Negative

-   Exploratory Data Analysis: How do averages look across various groups?

    -   Sometimes, simple averages can tell us so much!

-   Correlation matrix to understand variable trends & relationships

    -   What goes together, may give us clues to help us answer our research questions

-   Linear regression to explain the drivers of employee engagement

## Department by Engagement {.smaller style="color: black; size=10"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size:20px;"}
-   A statistical test found significant differences in engagement between departments

-   Software engineering has nearly double the favorability as compared to all other departments

-   What is software engineering doing differently that makes such a dramatic difference?

    -   Opportunity to leverage those findings and re-engineer the solutions to other segments of the company

-   On the whole, engagement is \~ 25% favorable, which is poor

-   Employee engagement has been found to drive key organizational outcomes like profitability and market share

## Special Projects and Engagement {.smaller style="color: black; size=10"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size:20px;"}
-   We plotted engagement scores across special projects to better understand how special projects affects employee engagement

-   The red box indicates employees who have a low engagement score and a high number of special projects

-   These employees seem to be at risk for being overworked and subsequent burnout

-   It's not all bad news, though, highly engaged employees with special projects \< 10 are quite numerous

## Correlation Analysis {.smaller style="color: black; size=10"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size:20px;"}
-   **Satisfaction, engagement** and **performance** are nearly perfectly correlated

    -   All these metrics are critical to unlocking organizational performance

-   Nearly all variables have positive relationships with job performance and employee engagement, except for salary and tenure

-   Engagement is significantly correlated with **special projects, tenure, salary and time zone difference**

-   Correlation does not imply causation, which metrics are the driver?

-   Research studies reached concensus on determining that job engagement leads to job performance, which makes sense

## Linear Regression {.smaller style="color: black; size=10"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size:20px;"}
-   Regression serves as a useful feature to tease apart which predictors have more leverage on engagement

-   The analysis found nearly all the features to be significant

-   **Salary** has the highest weight for explaining employee engagement by a significant margin, followed by the **time zone difference, number of special projects and manager tenure**

    -   Special projects should however be limited to \< 15 per 6 month period

-   In essence, according to our very bare-bones model, everything seems to matter and drive impact

-   The really interesting finding is **time zone difference**, which could lead to an organizational culture analysis

-   Managers with higher tenure also seem to know and understand how to engage their workforce

## Beyond the Data {.smaller style="color: black"}

-   Better understand the culture of Atlassian

    -   Do teams effectively collaborate and trust one another?

    -   Does information flow freely through the organization?

    -   Are employees mission-oriented?

-   Deeper dive into how Atlassian hires, retains and manages their workforce

-   Better understand the "psychometric" properties of the tools used to report out these metrics

## Conclusions {style="color: black; font-size:25px"}

-   Employee engagement, satisfaction and job performance are all heavily positively correlated with one another, to an almost inseperable degree

-   A simple linear regression showed us that a one unit increase in our engagement score (scale of 1-5) would lead to a .7 increase in our performance rating scale (scale 1-4), which is a very high change meaning that engagement impacts performance significantly, at an almost 1 to 1 ratio

-   A large time zone difference between employee and manager results in higher levels of employee engagement, one interpretation of this finding is a manager is less able to micro-manage, which hints at the broader organizational culture of the organization

-   Managers with higher tenure also seem to increase employee engagement

-   Employee engagement fluctuates significantly across different departments, more analyses need to be conducted to better understand how the successful departments engage employees

-   To a certain degree, special projects help boost employee engagement, but anything more than 15 projects will have an adverse effect on an employee's engagement levels

## Next Steps {.smaller style="color: black"}

-   Meet with leaders in departments that have high employee engagement scores (Software Engineering, Sales), to better understand their approach (DevOps, Agile, Scrum)

    -   Apply findings to other areas of the organization

-   Immediately address employees with a significant number of projects (greater than 15) for potential burnout, keep projects at a maximum of 15 to maintain employee engagement

-   Create focus groups with high tenured managers to better understand how they interact and engage with their employees, this work could potentially lead to a pilot study based on the information learned from these focus group sessions

-   Meet with the external vendor to drill deeper into engagement into areas such as: career development, well-being, job security, autonomy, work-life balance to better understand which parts of employee engagement Atlassian is doing well/not so well

-   Gather more data. Especially dimensions on Performance/Engagement

## Study Assumptions {.smaller style="color: black"}

-   The term "employee engagement" could mean a wide range of issues, for the purposes of this study we are assuming this is a composite metric across a wide variety of sub-topics

    -   The engagement scale has a min/max of 1-5. We assume 1 = low engagement and 5 = high engagement

-   Previous performance rating and current performance rating have identical distributions

-   What do we mean by "job performance" or "engagement"?

-   Are the surveys developed psychometrically valid?
