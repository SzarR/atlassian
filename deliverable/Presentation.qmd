## Background

-   Address rumors of employee engagement scores trending negatively
-   Better understand what drives engagement and its subsequent impact on performance
-   Provided with a dataset with several key metrics, including survey results, performance ratings and employee information
-   Goal: Provide leaders with actionable insights for course correcting low engagement scores
    -   But also helping leaders understand the cost of low engagement to the organization

## Purpose

-   Why care about employee engagement?

    -   Companies with highly engaged employees grew revenue 2.5x than those with low engaged employees

    -   When employees connect their work to customer impact, they identify with the company's purpose which leads to organizational performance

    -   Employees are Atlassian's greatest asset. By investing in them to do their best work, they will be more likely to exert themselves to be more successful

    -   In a software company, the capability to deliver quality software quickly certainly serves as a strategic advantage

## Procedure

-   What did we do to the data in order for it to tell us what we wanted to know?

-   First, we set up our variables in a way that makes more sense to analyze

    -   Calculated the time difference between time zones to understand whether the gap is meaningful

    -   Translated performance ratings into numeric values - to calculate averages

    -   Developed a novel "Engagement Favorability Index" that collapsed a 5-point scale into Positive/Negative

-   Exploratory Data Analysis: How do averages look across various groups?

    -   Sometimes, simple averages can tell us so much!

-   Correlation matrix to understand variable trends & relationships

    -   What goes together, may give us clues to help us answer our research questions

-   Linear regression to explain the drivers of employee engagement
